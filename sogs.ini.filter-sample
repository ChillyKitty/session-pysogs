; This file describes the settings you can use for advanced filtering controls.
;
; Note that when configuring this, it does *not* go in a separate file but rather in your active
; sogs.ini configuration file.  (Since everything goes here in a separate section, it doesn't matter
; where in sogs.ini you add it).


;
; Room-specific filtering
;
; To set filtration rules for a specific room you add a [room:TOKEN] section and then set the
; rules that should apply to this specific room.  For example, to enable the profanity filter and
; disallow (only) cyrillic characters in the room with token 'sudoku' you would add:
;
;[room:sudoku]
;profanity_filter=yes
;profanity_silent=yes
;alphabet_filters=cyrillic
;
; This overrides the default from the main [messages] config section for any given keys, so it can
; be used to replace or change the rules that apply to a given room.  Currently only the
; profanity_filter, profanity_silent, alphabet_filters can be overridden in this way.

;
; Filtration responses
;
; When a message is filtered because of the profanity or alphabet filtrations SOGS can optionally
; send a reply in the room; this reply can either be visible to everyone, or just to the specific
; user.  To enable such a reply, add a filter section here: the section name consists of
; 'filter:TYPE:ROOM' where TYPE and ROOM are the filtration type and room token, or '*' to match all
; types/rooms.
;
; Section names for all filtered messages:
;[filter:*:*]
;
; Section names for a particular filtration type:
;[filter:*:profanity]
;[filter:*:alphabet]
;
; The "type" can also be a specific language:
;[filter:*:arabic]
;[filter:*:cyrillic]
; etc.
;
; Room-specific filtration section names:
;
;[filter:fishing:*]
;[filter:sudoku:profanity]
;
; If using both '*' and specific values, the value from the more specific section will be used where
; present.
;
; Within this section there are currently three settings:
;
; - reply -- the body of a reply to send (see details below).  If omitted or empty then no reply
;   will be sent.
; - profile_name -- the profile name to use in that reply.
; - public -- whether the reply should be seen by everyone or just the poster.  The default is 'no'
;   (i.e. only the user will see the reply).
;
; The `reply` value should be specified on a single line of the config, and supports the following
; substitutions:
;
; \@ - the profile name, in @tag form, of the poster whose message was declined.
; \p - the profile name in plain text.
; \r - the name of the room
; \t - the token of the room
; \n - a line break
; \\ - a literal \ character
;
; You can also randomize among multiple responses by specifying multiple lines in the config: each
; additional line must be indented in the .ini file to be properly recognized.
;
; For example if you use this config:
;

[messages]
profanity_filter=yes
profanity_silent=yes
alphabet_filters=arabic cyrillic
alphabet_silent=yes

[room:sailors]
profanity_filter=no

[filter:*:*]
profile_name=LanguagePolice
reply=Hi \@, I'm afraid your message couldn't be sent: \r is English-only!

[filter:*:profanity]
profile_name=Swear Jar
reply=Whoa there, \@!  That language is too strong for the \r group!  Try the Sailors group instead.

[filter:sudoku:profanity]
profile_name=Bot45
public=yes
reply=\@ got a little too enthusiastic today with their solve.  Maybe someone can assist?
 Uh oh, I think \@ has two ï¼“s in the same row!
 I think \@'s sudoku broke ðŸ˜¦

; then arabic/cyrillic/person would be blocked everywhere, profanity would be blocked everywhere
; except the 'sailors' room, and when a message is blocked you would get a message such as one of
; the following depending on the room and the rule applied:
;
;
; (LanguagePolice)
; Hi @Foreignsailor1988, I'm afraid your message couldn't be set: Salty Sailors is English-only!
;
;
; (Swear Jar)
; Whoa there @87yearoldgrandma!  That language is too strong for the Cuddly Kittens group!  Try the Sailors group instead.
;
;
; (Bot45); [one of the following would be sent randomly, visible to everyone in the group]
; @87yearoldgrandma got a little too enthusiastic today with their solve.  Maybe someone can assist?
;
; Uh oh, I think @87yearoldgrandma has two ï¼“s in the same row!
;
; I think @87yearoldgrandma's sudoku broke ðŸ˜¦
